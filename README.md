# Audrino-Boat
Audrino code for EGR215 boat project
Objective: To create a battery powered motorboat  

Project Needs To: The boat needs to make a figure 8 in a 45‚Äù inflatable swimming pool without sinking. 

Considerations: Need to consider nature of materials if they are waterproof or not, size of boat, total weight of boats and components and the capacity of the battery we use.  

Questions: What type of design will support and protect the Arduino circuit while also being fully functional to make the boat complete its required task (making a figure 8)?
